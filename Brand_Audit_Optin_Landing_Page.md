### Section 1: The Problem

**Section Headline:**
## Most Professional Services Firms Are the "Best-Kept Secret" in Their Market

Great at what they do.
Invisible to the clients who need them.

You didn't spend years mastering your craft to compete on price with generalists.

But without a clear brand, that's exactly what happens:
- Ideal clients don't know you exist
- You sound like everyone else
- You chase work instead of attracting it

**The fix isn't more marketing. It's knowing where to focus.**

---

### Section 2: What You'll Get

**Section Headline:**
## The 7-Point Brand Checkup

This worksheet scores your brand across 7 critical areas:

| Area | What It Measures |
|------|-----------------|
| **1. Message Clarity** | Can prospects instantly understand what you do and why it matters to them? |
| **2. Website Effectiveness** | Does your site convert visitors into leads — or just look pretty? |
| **3. LinkedIn Presence** | Are you building authority where your clients spend time? |
| **4. Google Presence** | What do prospects find when they search your name? |
| **5. Authority Content** | Do you have visible proof of your expertise? |
| **6. Lead Capture** | Is there a system to turn interest into booked calls? |
| **7. Response Speed** | How fast do you respond to new enquiries? |

**Your lowest score = your biggest opportunity.**

Fix that one thing first. Everything else becomes easier.

---

### Section 3: How It Works

**Section Headline:**
## 15 Minutes → 90 Days of Clarity

**Step 1:** Download the worksheet (instant PDF)

**Step 2:** Score yourself 1-10 in each area (be honest)

**Step 3:** Identify your weakest link

**Step 4:** Use the Priority Planner to map your next 90 days

No fluff. No theory. Just a clear answer to: *"What should I work on first?"*

---

### Section 4: Who This Is For

**Section Headline:**
## Built for Professional Services Firms

This worksheet works best for:

✓ **Accountants & Tax Advisors** — Stand out in a sea of "full-service accounting"
✓ **Business Consultants** — Stop competing on hourly rates
✓ **Financial Planners** — Attract clients who value advice, not just products
✓ **Lawyers & Legal Advisors** — Build a practice that doesn't depend on referrals alone
✓ **Specialist B2B Services** — Position as the obvious choice in your niche

If you're excellent at what you do but struggle to get that across to new clients, this is for you.

---

### Section 5: Problems We Solve

Here's your Brand Audit Worksheet: [Download Link]

Quick tip: Block 15 minutes and do it now. The insights are freshest when you act fast.

Your goal isn't a perfect score today.

Your lowest score = your biggest opportunity.

Talk soon,
Dallas

P.S. Hit reply and tell me your lowest-scoring area. I'll send you one specific tip to improve it.

### Email 2: Day 2 - Did You Complete It?

**Subject:** Did you find your weakest link?

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick check-in — did you get a chance to complete the Brand Audit?

If not, no stress. Here's the link again: [Download Link]

If you did, I'm curious: **What was your lowest score?**

Most professionals I work with score lowest in one of these three:

1. **Message Clarity** — You're great at what you do, but struggle to explain why it matters
2. **Authority Content** — Your expertise lives in your head, not on the internet
3. **Response Speed** — Leads go cold because you're too busy delivering to reply fast

Which one hit home for you?

Hit reply and let me know. I've got specific resources for each.

### Email 3: Day 4 - The One Thing

**Subject:** The one thing that changes everything

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Here's what I've learned from hundreds of brand audits:

**Trying to fix everything at once = fixing nothing.**

The firms that actually improve do this instead:

1. Find the lowest score
2. Define what a "7" would look like in 90 days
3. Take 3 actions this week toward that

That's it.

Not five priorities. Not a rebrand. Just one focused improvement.

If your lowest score was **Response Speed**, here's a quick win:

Our AI receptionist AIVA can answer your calls 24/7, qualify leads, and send them to your calendar — so you never miss an opportunity while you're with clients.

It's like having a $60K/year receptionist for $49/month.

Want to hear how it sounds? Call **+61 468 080 000** and AIVA will give you a live demo.

Talk soon,
Dallas
