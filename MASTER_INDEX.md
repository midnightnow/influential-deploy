# MOONSHOT (2035)

>
> When a serious professional firm decides to "get their act together," they either work directly with Influential or copy someone who did.

---

# KEY QUOTES (From The Archive)

### On Influence
> "When everything is connected, positioning is everything."

> "Influence based on positive values and goals has power, boldness and magic."

> "Most people leave influence to chance."

### On Innovation
> "The profitability is in the wake of the cutting edge."

> "The people who make money in any new industry aren't the inventors, they are the appliers."

> "You don't need to be first, smartest, or best. You just need to be willing to learn, share, and apply."

### On Client Attraction
> "We help people who want to 'own the racecourse' to build racecourses."

> "Unlike most sales and marketing where the vendor pursues the buyer, we want to attract clients to come to us."
