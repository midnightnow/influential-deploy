### Section 1: The Problem

**Section Headline:**
## Every Missed Call Is Money Walking Out the Door

You're excellent at what you do. But you can't be in two places at once.

When you're with a client, in a meeting, or just living your life — the phone doesn't stop ringing.

**What happens to those calls?**

❌ Voicemail (that nobody checks until it's too late)
❌ "Please hold" (they hang up and call your competitor)
❌ Nothing (after-hours enquiries disappear into the void)

**The brutal math:**
- Average missed call costs a professional firm $500-2,000 in lifetime value
- 40% of business calls go to voicemail
- 85% of callers who hit voicemail don't leave a message
- First responder wins 78% of the time

You're not losing leads because your service is bad.
You're losing them because you can't answer fast enough.

### Email 2: Day 2 - The Math

**Subject:** The real cost of missed calls

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick question: How many calls did you miss last week?

Here's the math most firms don't think about:

- Average new client = $3,000-10,000/year in fees
- 40% of business calls go to voicemail
- 85% of voicemail callers never call back

Even if only ONE of those missed calls would have become a client...

That's why AIVA exists. $49/month to never miss another opportunity.

### Email 3: Day 4 - After Hours

**Subject:** What happens to your leads at 2am?

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Your best prospects are busy during business hours too.

They research at night. On weekends. During lunch breaks.

When they finally pick up the phone to call you... you're not there.

By the time you call back (24-48 hours later), they've already booked with someone else.

AIVA answers at 2am just like she does at 2pm. Same script. Same quality. Same result: appointments in your calendar.

Call her right now and see: +61 468 080 000
