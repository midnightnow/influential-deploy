## FORMAT 4: Problem-Agitate-Solution (For Long-Form)

### Example: The After-Hours Problem

**Problem:**
You're losing leads while you sleep. Every missed call after 5pm is a potential client who called your competitor next.

**Agitate:**
Think about it: your best prospects are busy during business hours too. They research at night, on weekends, during lunch breaks. When they finally pick up the phone, you're unavailable. They leave a voicemail (maybe). You call back 24-48 hours later. By then? They've already booked with someone else.

**Solution:**
AIVA answers every call, 24/7, following your exact script. Qualifies the caller. Books them straight into your calendar. You wake up to consultations, not voicemails.

---

### Example: The Invisible Expert Problem

**Problem:**
You're excellent at what you do. But online, you look like every other [accountant/consultant/planner] in your city.

**Agitate:**
Your website says "full-service accounting" or "helping businesses grow." So does everyone else's. When a prospect searches for help, they see a wall of identical-looking firms. No one stands out. So they pick based on price or proximity. Your expertise? Irrelevant. Your track record? Invisible.

**Solution:**
The Brand Audit scores your Message Clarity out of 10. Most professionals score 4-5. We show you exactly what's missing and how to reposition as the obvious choice for your ideal client. Not "business consultant." Something like "growth strategist for family businesses." Specific. Memorable. Referable.
